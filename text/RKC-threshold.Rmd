## Objective
Develop methods manage Southeast Alaska red king crab using a biological threshold and to establish this biological threshold using survey biomass estimates.
Ideally this threshold would be used to determine a harvest control rule for more sustainable management.

## Background
Currently the red king crab fishery in Southeast Alaska is managed, in regulation, using a clause that opens the fishery as long as there is a 200,000 pound surplus for harvest.  However, there is no guidance given as to how this surplus should or can be determined or guidance on the level that the population should be sustained. 
Data available for use in this analysis is survey CPUE of all size and sex classes, fishey catch and CPUE (although the fishery has only opened once in the last decade), and mature male biomass estimated using a catch-survey analysis model (CSA) from survey CPUE and harvest data.  

Establishing biological reference points for this fishery would aid in more effective management. Opening and closing of the regional fishery could be based on the threhold estimated from survey data and appropriate harvest rates could still be determined based on the individual stock health of the surveyed areas, as is currently done.


## Methods

#### Long term average of biomass estimates

#### Average yield
This is hard to use due to the sparse nature of the fishery.  There has been a fishery about once a 
decade which makes it hard to use yield or harvest as an indicator of population status or condition.

#### Biological reference points - biomass-based
Could use a sliding scale to reduce fishing mortality as stock declines.
Need to attempt to establish a B0, and determine the compensatory capacity of the stock.
    
#### Stoplight method based on biological threshold
This method relies on an average survey biomass estimate to establish zones of stock status or health. The long-term averagve biomass would set green, yellow, and red levels that would dictact fishery openings and closures, in addition to aiding in determining the level of caution needed for setting harvest levels. 

As an example, if the current year's biomass estimate was above the long-term average, here called the "mature target reference point", the population would be considered "healthy". If the current year's estimate lie between the long-term average and 50% of that average, the "trigger point", the population would be considered in "average or moderate" status. When the current year's estimate is between 50% (trigger) and 25% of the long-term average (limit reference point) then the population would be considered "below average" status. When the current year's estimate is below 20% of the long-term average then the population would be considered "poor".
