## Objective
Develop methods manage Southeast Alaska red king crab using a biological threshold and to establish this biological threshold using survey biomass estimates.
Ideally this threshold would be used to determine a harvest control rule for more sustainable management.

## Background
Currently the red king crab fishery in Southeast Alaska is managed, in regulation, using a clause that opens the fishery as long as there is a 200,000 pound surplus for harvest.  However, there is no guidance given as to how this surplus should or can be determined or guidance on the level that the population should be sustained. 
Data available for use in this analysis is survey CPUE of all size and sex classes, fishey catch and CPUE (although the fishery has only opened once in the last decade), and mature male biomass estimated using a catch-survey analysis model (CSA) from survey CPUE and harvest data (Figure 1).  

Establishing biological reference points for this fishery would aid in more effective management. Opening and closing of the regional fishery could be based on the threhold estimated from survey data and appropriate harvest rates could still be determined based on the individual stock health of the surveyed areas, as is currently done.


## Methods

### Estimating biological threholds
In most cases a biological threhold is based on average biomass or recruitment for a period of time that is considered "normal" or typical for the stock. In many crab stocks this period of time is the entire time series minus the current year (here 1979 - 2018). However, there have also been adjustments to this time frame based on regime shifts, survey methodology changes, and general knowledge of the stock and the environment. 

#### Average yield
This is hard to use due to the sparse nature of the fishery.  There has been a fishery about once a 
decade which makes it hard to use yield or harvest as an indicator of population status or condition.

#### Biological reference points (biomass-based)
One method would be to use a sliding scale to reduce fishing mortality as stock declines.
Need to attempt to establish a B0, and determine the compensatory capacity of the stock. This is fairly hard to do without an idea of B0 or the virgin biomass (biomass prior to fishing pressure).
    
#### Stoplight method based on biological threshold
This method relies on an average survey biomass estimate to establish zones of stock status or health. The long-term averagve biomass would set green, yellow, and red levels that would dictact fishery openings and closures, in addition to aiding in determining the level of caution needed for setting harvest levels. 

As an example, if the current year's biomass estimate was above the long-term average, here called the "mature target reference point", the population would be considered "healthy". If the current year's estimate lie between the long-term average and 50% of that average, the "trigger point", the population would be considered in "average or moderate" status. When the current year's estimate is between 50% (trigger) and 25% of the long-term average (limit reference point) then the population would be considered "below average" status. When the current year's estimate is below 20% of the long-term average then the population would be considered "poor". 

Federally managed crab stocks in western Alaska use a managment framework where a stock is considered "overfished" when the current year's biomass is below 50% of the average (below the orange/yellow line). At this point a rebuilding plan is put into place to ensure that the stock rebuilds to average levels, this does not necessarily mean the directed fishery but most often that is the case. 

Figure 4 below shows three examples of harvest control rules that could be applied to this method. Option 1 allows for maximum harvest when the stock is above the mature target reference point (long-term average), then decreases between 20 to 10 % linearly when the stock is between the mature target reference point and the trigger reference point, and then makes further reductions when the stock is between the trigger and limit reference points. The fishery would be closed is the current stock biomass was below 20% of the mature target reference point. This options is the most risky or least conservative. Option 2 is similar to option 1 at high biomass but the fishery would be closed when the stock is below the Trigger reference point. Option 3 is the most conservative, since it linearly decreases the harvest from 20 to 0 % between the mature target reference point and the trigger reference point. These options are just examples of how a biological threshold or target reference point could be used for setting a harvest control rule.
